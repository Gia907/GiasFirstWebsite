            <p> Music is a way to express youself with harmony and words. However, some people find it hard to express themselves with sounds. The reason might be that they aren't listening to the 
            right type of music. <br> Music will sound different depending on where you are. For example, in funerals you don't listen to bright happy songs. You listen to instrumental songs that match the mood. It's the same for the seasons.
            This website will be a guide on which songs to listen to, too match the ambience of your surroundings.
